# Final Project ADA Spring 2020
 This repository includes the files necessary to reproduce the survival analysis of Korea COVID-19 data presented in class.
 
 All analysis can be re-run by running **__master_analysis_script.R** and the presentation re-created by running **__presentation.Rmd**.
 
 The folders are organized as follows:
 
 * 00_R: loads necessary packages and any user-created functions
 * 01_data: loads data files into R working environment. Raw data was downlodaded from: https://www.kaggle.com/kimjihoo/coronavirusdataset.
 * 02_analysis: files used to conduct analysis
 * 03_output: images and tables used in presentation
