## COVID-19 in Korea
- __Global__
    + 2,501,156 Confirmed Cases
    + 171,810 Deaths

- __South Korea__
    + 10,683 Confirmed Cases
    + 237 Deaths

- __Why South Korea?__
    + Foreign Minister (Kang Kyung-wha), Korea CDC, Prime Minister and Task Force
    + Transparency of data
    + Rapid & Free Country-Wide Testing
    + Open Surveillance and Open Data Sources

## Risk Factors for Mortality
- Age (mixed evidence)
    + Important independent predictor of mortality in SARS and MERS.
    + Increased age was associated with death in patients with COVID-19.
    + Most deaths seen in those aged 40-60.

- Sex (male)
    + More deaths reported in males in both China & Italy.
    + Possible confounding with smoking and comorbidities.

- Geographic Clustering & Policies
    + Early adaptation of social distancing & closures
    + Proximity to 'Patient 0' and metropolitan living
    + Shincheonji Church Outbreak - 63.5% of all cases

## Korean Provinces

knitr::include_graphics("./03_output/presentation_images/korea_provinces.png")
```


## Objectives
- Identify demographic and regional characteristics that impact survival of COVID-19 in South Korea
- Add to the novel body of literature about COVID-19 patterns

## Data Source

```{r, out.width = "1200px"}
knitr::include_graphics("./03_output/presentation_images/kaggle.png")
```

- Retrospective cohort study
    + COVID-19 Diagnosis between Jan 20, 2020 to Apr 20, 2020

- Exclusion Criteria
    + Only including provinces with at least 1 death: Busan, Daegu, Gangwon-do, Gyeonggi-do, Gyeongsangbuk-do, Seoul, Ulsan
    
## Analysis Plan
- All analysis conducted using __R 3.6.3__. 
    + Analysis packages: *survival*, *survminer*
    + Visualization packages: *ggplot2*, *leaflet*, *sjPlot*
    
- Visualizations: geographic distribution, density plots, Kaplan-Meier plots

- Cox proportional hazard regression:
    + Survival days: # of days between confirmed and death or release (or 4/20, if still under observation)
    + Outcome: death
    + Covariates: age (calculated from birth year), sex, province
    
## DAG
```{r, out.width = "1200px"}
knitr::include_graphics("./03_output/presentation_images/DAG_HW10.png")
```
    
## Statistical Analysis
The *hazard function* is the instantaneous risk of death at time $t$, conditional on survival up to that time:
$$h(t) = \lim_{\Delta t\rightarrow0} \frac{Pr[(t \leq T < t + \Delta t | T \geq t)]}{\Delta t}$$

- Data is __right-censored__

*Cox proportional-hazards model* for relationship of survival distribution to covariates:

$$h_{i}(t) = h_{0}(t) \exp(\alpha + \beta_{sex}x_{i,sex} + \beta_{age}x_{i, age} + \beta_{province}x_{i, province})$$

## Model Assumptions: Proportional Hazards

We assume __proportional hazards__. This is acceptable, using the cox.zph function to test.

```{r}
par(mfrow=c(2, 2))
plot(cox.zph(surv_cox))
```

## Model Assumptions: No Influential Cases

We assume no influential cases. This does not hold at the province level, but in certain provinces only 1 or 2 deaths were recorded.

```{r}
dfbeta <- residuals(surv_cox, type="dfbeta")

par(mfrow=c(3,3))
for (j in 1:8) {
    plot(dfbeta[, j], ylab=names(coef(surv_cox))[j])
    abline(h=0, lty=2)
}
```

## Key Results
- In our study locations, 2.4% of those diagnosed with COVID-19 have died.

- There are statistically significant associations between sex and age and time to event.
    + There is a __8% increase__ (HR = 1.08, 95% CI: 1.06-1.10) in the expected hazard relative to a one-year increase in age, holding sex and province constant.
    + Men have a __233% higher__ (HR = 3.33, 95% CI: 1.99-5.57) expected hazard relative to women, holding age and province constant.

- There are statistically significant associations by province as well, although we caution that due to very low death counts it is difficult to draw any conclusions.
    + Specifically, Daegu has a __1030% higher__ (HR = 11.3, 95% CI: 3.30-38.4) expected hazard relative to Busan, holding sex and age constant.

## Consistency

```{r, out.height= "320px"}
knitr::include_graphics("./03_output/presentation_images/wsj_scj.png")
```

- Daegu's Shincheonji Church made international news for its role in worsening the spread of COVID-19 in South Korea by reportedly hiding names of members.

- Early results from China and Italy also suggest that age and sex are risk factors for mortality. (Wu and McGoogan, 2020; Jordan, Adab, and Cheng, 2020; Livingston and Bucher, 2020)

## Strengths and Limitations
__Strengths__

- South Korean data collection systems are very strong; contact tracing mechanisms suggest reliable data.

- To our knowledge, no survival analysis published on COVID-19 cases in South Korea.

__Limitations__

- Low death counts are good! But they make drawing inferences about survival from covariates challenging.

- Important unobserved variables: smoking status, prior chronic disease, secondary infection.

- Province is not a fine-enough level of geographic analysis.

## Future Directions
- Statistical improvment: multilevel modeling for the province term
- Incorporate key unobserved variables: smoking status, chronic disease, secondary infection.
- Use tracking data to examine infection patterns
